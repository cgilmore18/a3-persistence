Your Web Application Title

our glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. https://a3-carley-gilmore.glitch.me/

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

the goal of the application
challenges you faced in realizing the application
what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
what CSS framework you used and why
include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does

Tech Achievement 1: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy

# Assignment 3

My Glitch account https://a3-carley-gilmore.glitch.me/

The goal of the application is to provide users with a virtual to-do list. Users sign in, fill out the task form to add tasks to their list, double click on tasks at the bottom to delete, and click on the editable text in the list to edit.

Challenges I faced in making the application was certainly setting up the Express server and getting MongoDB to work. The login part also has given me some trouble in terms of storing the data of each user up into the database.

The authenication strategy I chose was the basic comparison one where another database is created in MongoDB for storing user data and the data is in the form of a JSON object with a username, password, and id. 

The CSS framework that I used is Cirrus because it is super simple and I thought that it went nicely with the purpose of my simple to-do list.

The 5+ Express middleware packages I used are: 
-bodyParser: Body parser converts strings to JSON objects and JSON objects into strings.
-helmet: Helmet helps secure the application by setting various HTTP headers in the app.
-timeout: Returns middleware that times out in time milliseconds. On timeout, the request will emit "timeout".
-morgan: HTTP logger
-compression: compress HTTP responses

-I also attempted to use passport for authentication.

(5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service like Heroku or Digital Ocean. Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse?
Design/UX

(10 points) The 12 W3 guidelines are:
◦Provide informative, unique page titles
  My web application has titles and subtitles for every different part and field
◦Use headings to convey meaning and structure
  The title heading gives details on what the use of the application is- "iPrioritize"-application revolves around prioritize
◦Make link text meaningful
  My application has a link that goes to another website with a descriptive name of the link instead of a URL.
◦Provide clear instructions
  Before each one of my fields I have instructions on what the user should enter as well as how to enter them and where the 

Write meaningful text alternatives for images
I have an image for an alternative to explain to choose one priority in the priority list

◦Keep content clear and concise
My application has clear usage of words that are not difficult to comprehend. The language is strictly imperative and helps navigate the user to complete the fields and create, add, and modify tasks.

◦Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background
  The background is white and the text is black which minimizes the chances of content being inaccessible
  
◦Don’t use color alone to convey information
I have fields that are marked in red with asterisks which are required to be filled out as mentioned on the W3 website

◦Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels
Each form element has a link that helps the user know which form element is which.

◦Use headings and spacing to group related content
I have subheadings to group related content. Each heading of the form is of the same size to indicate that it is in the same grouping. Your generated to-do list is also of a different heading size since it is a different grouping. The overall title is the biggest size on the page.

◦Include image and media alternatives in your design
I have an image alternative as mentioned in my design

◦Associate a label with every form control
Every form control has a label Ex: priority has a label for every radio button


(5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings. Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page? How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page? What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site? How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements. Write a paragraph of at least 125 words for each of four principles (four paragraphs, 500 words in total).

Contrast: My website is primarily a simple website, which gives it some room to have many accounts of contrast. The black lettering on the simple white background is the starkest contrast featured on the webpage. This contrast makes the webpage even more accessible to everyone. The less colors featured, the better, especially in the text. I wanted to make sure that this contrast allowed the user to read every element on the page and be able to complete every field to create, add, and modify a task. There is also contrast with the red lettering on the white background. This lettering pops out on the page the most with its large font and bright coloring. Red makes the user think right away that the colored content is important and worth reading, which is contrasted with the calming white and grey undertones.
